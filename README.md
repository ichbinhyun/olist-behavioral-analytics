## Summary
This project analyzes user behavior on the Olist e-commerce platform by segmenting both customers and sellers, calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), and uncovering actionable insights to address major business challenges. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, the analysis identifies low repurchase rates, high seller dormancy, and category performance imbalances as core issues. Through a structured data-driven approach, the report proposes targeted CRM and marketing strategies such as review-triggered loyalty campaigns and seller reactivation programs to enhance retention, drive sales, and optimize platform efficiency.

## Problem Statement
This projectâ€™s problem statement focuses on **analyzing the behavioral patterns** of Olistâ€™s **core users (customers and sellers)** and segmenting them in a meaningful way. Furthermore, it aims to identify actionable insights that support long-term platform growth by enhancing seller engagement, increasing customer retention, and optimizing product variety to meet both supply and demand effectively.

- Who are the customers and sellers?
- How are their behaviors?
- How can we increase the number of active sellers on the platform?
- How can we increase sellers' consistent activity and customer retention?
- How can we help sellers increase their sales performance?
- How can we ensure product variety that benefits both sellers and customers, without pushing products that donâ€™t sell?

## About Business
Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized sellers to major online marketplaces, such as Mercado Livre, B2W, and others. By offering a unified storefront and operational support, including logistics, payments, and customer service, Olist lowers the entry barrier for local merchants and helps them scale efficiently. Rather than selling products directly, Olist operates as a marketplace enabler, earning revenue through commissions, seller subscription fees, and service fees on each transaction. Its business model thrives on the success of its sellers, making platform growth and seller performance critical to its profitability. This dual-sided ecosystem, which contains buyers and sellers, forms the foundation of Olistâ€™s value proposition in the competitive e-commerce landscape.

## About Dataset
This **real-world dataset**, collected from a large-scale e-commerce platform between 2016 and 2018, contains over 100,000 orders and provides rich insights into consumer behavior, seller performance, and operational dynamics. It serves as a strong foundation for behavioral analytics, user segmentation, and performance benchmarking on a dual-sided marketplace.
